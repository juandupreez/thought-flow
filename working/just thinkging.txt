    while true:
        rule = fetchNextRule(cur_rule)
        decoded_rule = decode(rule)
        decoded_rule.execute()


For example, print all letters in "sky"

    Fetch sequence of letters for word "sky" in kb to working memory
        OP: FETCH word:sky into working_memory_1
    move first letter of "sky" to active concept
        OP: APPLY_RULE get_first_item working_memory_1
    print active concept
        OP: PRINT single character
    get next letter of "sky" after "s" to active concept
        OP: APPLY_RULE get_next_item working_memory_1 "s"
    print active concept
        OP: PRINT single character
    get next letter of "sky" after "k" to active concept
        OP: APPLY_RULE get_next_item working_memory_1 "k"
    print active concept
        OP: PRINT single character
    get next letter of "sky" after "y" to active concept
        OP: APPLY_RULE get_next_item working_memory_1 "y"
    print active concept
        OP: HALT
