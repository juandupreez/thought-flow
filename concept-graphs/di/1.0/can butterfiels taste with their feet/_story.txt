P1:
One evening, the Tiny Detectives 
were making supper when 
Tyga, who was the middle 
one in the Tiny family 
asked a big question. 
"Can butterfles taste with their feet"

P2:
"Of course they can't. Don't 
be silly!", said Olly, who was the 
eldest, so he always thought he knew best.
"While supper is cooling,
let's jump into a book and find out!" said Mum

P3:
So the Tiny
Detectives climbed
the bookcase and Mum picked outa book called
BUTTERFLIES OF THE PACIFIC
Then Dad wound the red story-thread
around his waist,
so they could get
back out of the story at the
end of their adventure...
